• Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not. 

All the work that has been asked has been successfully implemented such as developing the html, using CSS for styling and JavaScript for the functions on the web page. 
The sole problem while running the html through the validator indicates that there is an error from line 366 indicating a slash (“/”) is missing. 
The CSS file has been error free while running from the validator. A button to switch from dark to light mode has been successfully implemented using JavaScript. 
Themes has been using through CSS to style the background, table and grid.
Comments were inserted in all three files to explain.
The file was successfully uploaded online via Netlify.

• Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment. 

For doing this assignment, the only help I obtained was from the internet such as W3 school and YouTube. 
For the theme switch, I learnt from YouTube from the following link: (7) Theme Changer Using JavaScript | Toggle Between Light And Dark Mode - YouTube .
After acquired the knowledge how to implement the button, I tried to develop mine which is successfully running. For the grid and table in my html, I have been using the code I learnt from W3Schools Online Web Tutorials where the tutorial is easily comprehensible. 
Basically these are the two sites that I learnt most to incorporate my assignment and especially using the class notes and lecture slides to refresh my memory about the topics taught.
W3 school was advantegeous as while running the code I could view the output on the screen besides it hence making the working faster and the exact way you expect it to be.
Youtube also is another teacher, as I have learnt a lot about other stuffs as well while doing my research. The major part of the JavaScript done was from video I watched on You Tube.

• Include how many hours you have spent completing the assignment

The assignment was completed in 1 week time (working on odd days) which is working on average 6 hours/day.
Implementing the structure such as paragraphs was easy but amendments as the assignment was progressing was challenging and time consuming.
