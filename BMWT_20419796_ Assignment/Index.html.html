  <hr>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible web-based applications.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know, understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes. Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.</p>

  </ul>
  <h3>Assessment Moderation</h3>
  <h4>Fair assessment through moderation</h4>
  <p>Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from <a href="https://http://policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy///">http://policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy</a></p>
  <h4>Pre-marking moderation</h4>
  <p>A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.</p>
  <h4>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</h4>
  <p>The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries</li>
    <li>Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where students have not met the pass requirements</li>
    <li>Analysis of the variances between markers and locations</li>
    <li>Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards</li>
  </ul><br>
  <h4>Late assessment</h4>
  <p>Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in this unit.</p>
  <p>Where a late assessment <b>is</b> permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>For assessment items submitted within the first 24 hours after the due date/time, students will be penalised by a deduction of 5% of the total marks allocated for the assessment task;</li>
    <li>For each additional 24 hour period commenced an additional penalty of 10% of the total marks allocated for the assessment item will be deducted; and</li>
    <li>Assessment items submitted more than 168 hours late (7 calendar days) will receive a mark of zero.</li>
  </ol><br>
  <p>Where late assessment <b>is NOT</b> permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will receive a mark of zero.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Assessment extension</h4>
  <p>Where an application for an assessment extension is permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit (refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A student who is unable to complete an assessment item by/on the due date/time as a result of exceptional circumstances beyond the student's control, may apply for an assessment extension on the Assessment Extension Application Form as prescribed by the Academic Registrar. The form is available on the Forms page at <a href="https://http://https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/forms//">https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/forms/</a> and also within the student's OASIS (My Studies tab-Quick Forms) account.
    </li>
    <li>The student will be expected to submit their application for an Assessment Extension with supporting documentation <a href="https://students.connect.curtin.edu.au/app/assessment_extension//">via the online form</a> .
    </li>
    <li>Timely submission of this information supports the assessment process. For applications that are declined, delayed submission may have significant ramifications on the possible marks awarded.</li>
    <li>An application may be accepted up to five working days after the due date/time of the assessment item where the student is able to provide a verifiable explanation as to why they were not able to submit the application prior to the assessment due date/time</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Where an application for an assessment extension is NOT permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit (refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will be subject to late penalties or receive a mark of zero depending on the unit permitting late assessment submissions.</li>
  </ol><br>
  <h4>Deferred assessments</h4>
  <p>If your results show that you have been granted a deferred assessment you should immediately check OASIS for details.</p>
  <h4>Further assessment</h4>
